# RiskCloudAPI SDK


## Overview

Risk Cloud API: Welcome to the Risk Cloud API v2! This is a collection of new API-first and RESTful API endpoints to streamline the creation of custom integrations with the Risk Cloud.

**Note**: These endpoints are currently in **open alpha**, meaning that backwards compatibility is not guaranteed and breaking changes are to be expected as the endpoints are finalized. The full release of these new v2 endpoints is anticipated for late 2023.

For our existing collections of v1 endpoints, 
please feel free to reference [Risk Cloud API v1](https://docs.logicgate.com).
